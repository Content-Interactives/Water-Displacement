## 📚 Standards & Subjects

This interactive aligns with the following topics and standards:

- **📂 Subject Area**: Middle School Science  
- **🧪 Topic**: Water Displacement — Understanding the concept of water displacement through experiments and simulations  
- **📏 Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)**:  
  - **MS-PS1-3** – Gather and make sense of information to describe that synthetic materials come from natural resources and impact society.  
  - **MS-PS2-4** – Construct and present arguments using evidence to support the claim that gravitational interactions are attractive and depend on the masses of interacting objects and the distance between them.  
  - **MS-PS2-5** – Conduct an investigation and evaluate the experimental design to provide evidence that fields exist between objects exerting forces on each other even though the objects are not in contact.
